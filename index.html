            <p> Walking into Plantin &#39;s printing workshop at 15, he heard the steady thud of presses and smelled fresh ink in the air. That first day, though the city felt new and overwhelming, Jan felt alive, his heart raced with curiosity and hope.</p>

            <p>He taught himself, turning into a <strong>polyglot and autodidact</strong> . By his early twenties, he stood not as a quiet assistant, but as <strong>Plantin &#39;s right-hand man</strong>.</p>

        <p>Jan, a self-made polyglot with ink-stained hands; Martina, educated from childhood and sharp in business. Together, they balanced each other perfectly, he made decisions; she managed operations.</p>

                <h3>A Project of Unbelievable Scale</h3>
                <p>One of Jan Moretus &#39;s boldest early moves came in 1569, while still under Plantin &#39;s leadership. Plantin had just finished his masterpiece: <strong>the Polyglot Bible</strong> , printed in five languages, on eight columns per page, with thousands of custom-made types. It was so massive, they called it the “Biblia Regia”, but in Antwerp it earned a better nickname: “the Elephant Bible.”</p>

        <h2>A Young Man on a Royal Mission</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Jan was only about 27 years old, but Plantin trusted him enough to let him <strong>travel to Spain</strong>  to negotiate the finances for the Bible &#39;s distribution with      &#39;s court. Imagine it: a young man, not yet a partner, stepping into royal chambers, carrying pages thicker than a handspan and a reputation thicker still.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>The stakes?</h3>
            <p>The Spanish Crown had bankrolled the project. If the King didn &#39;t approve or pay up, the entire print shop <strong>could go bankrupt.</strong></p>
            <p> Jan returned from Madrid not just with the King's blessing, but with the kind of calm, professional diplomacy that defined the rest of his life.</p>
            <p class="large">It was a test, and he passed it.</p>

            <h2>Turbulence & Trust: <br> During the Siege</h2>
            <p>Between 1582-85, Antwerp fell under siege.</p>
            <p>Christophe fled to Leiden, but Jan and Martina stayed. <strong>Under cannon fire</strong> and political collapse,  <strong>they kept presses running</strong>, staff employed, and prayers printed for the frightened citizens. Their calm in crisis was a testament to shared purpose, and it proved why Plantin entrusted Jan so deeply.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Guidance Through Reason</h3>
            <p>Jan adopted a personal motto on New Year &#39;s Day 1573: “ratio recta” (“straight thinking”).</p>
            <p>For Jan, that was more than a phrase, it was a compass. When pressures mounted, civil war, censorship, market competition, he focused on wise decisions.</p>

            <h3>Heir and Protector: <br> Securing the Legacy</h3>
            <p>When Plantin died in 1589, Jan officially became heir. But his path wasn &#39;t smooth.</p>
            <p>His brother-in-law, Gillis Beys, demanded a share in the press inheritance. Jan faced down legal challenges, mediating debts and honouring family, while avoiding the break-up of the press.</p>
        </div>
        <p>By March 1590, a compromise was agreed: Jan and Martina retained the central Antwerp operation, while Gillis took over a Paris branch. They preserved the unity of Officina Plantiniana, <strong>preventing the fragmentation of a European institution.</strong></p>

        <h2>Jan Today: <br> A Modern Mirror</h2>
        <p>Think of Jan today: a teenager from a <strong>modest background</strong>, mastering languages, <strong>dreaming big in a foreign place.</strong></p>
        <p>Someone who speaks many tongues, negotiates tough deals, and builds a future with intelligence and grit.</p>
        <p class="large">His journey, of adaptation, courage, clear thinking, feels familiar, no matter where you come from.</p>
