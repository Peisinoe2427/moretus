            <p> Walking into Plantin’s printing workshop at 15, he heard the steady thud of presses and smelled fresh ink in the air. That first day, though the city felt new and overwhelming, Jan felt alive, his heart raced with curiosity and hope.</p>

            <p>Jan didn’t stay quiet. He immersed himself, working first in the bookshop, then learning Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, everything he could.</p>
            <p>He taught himself, turning into a polyglot and autodidact. By his early twenties, he stood not as a quiet assistant, but as Plantin’s right-hand man.</p>

        <h2>Ink & Lace: The Union of Equals</h2>
        <p>In 1570, Jan married Martina Plantin, Christophe’s daughter. It wasn’t just a marriage, it was the fusion of tactile skill and strategic vision.</p>
        <p>Jan, a self-made polyglot with ink-stained hands; Martina, educated from childhood and sharp in business. Together, they balanced each other perfectly, he made decisions; she managed operations.</p>
